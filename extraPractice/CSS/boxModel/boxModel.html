<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>
  A computer program can easily produce gibberish - especially if it has been provided with garbage beforehand. This
  program does something a little different. It takes a block of text as input and works out the proportion of
  characters within the text according to a chosen order. For example, an order of 2 means the program looks at pairs
  of letters, an order of 3 means triplets of letters and so on. The software can regurgitate random text that is
  controlled by the proportion of characters. The results can be quite surprising.
