# Side Effect: -
In React, the concept of side effects causes to take place in any operation
that reaches outside the scope of a React component. These operations can effect
the other components, interact with the browser, or perform asynchronous fetching
the data. Example of these operations are: -
1. setTimeout
2. fetch
3. setInterval
4. document.getElementById("").innerHTML = ""

# Hooks: -
Hooks are a feature introduced in React 16.8 that allow you to use state and other
React features without writing a class. They enable functional components to have access
to stateful logic and lifecycle features, which were previously only possible in class
components. This has led to a more concise and readable way of writing components in React.
Some common hooks are
1. useState
2. useEffect
3. useCallback
4. useMemo
5. useRef
6. useContext
